    <h3>About me</h3>
	<br>
    <p>
    Hi dear reader! My name is Ren and I’m currently studying the Bachelor of Computer Science (Advanced) at the University of Adelaide. I was born in China and came to Australia when I was 8 years old. I’m bilingual and fluent in both English and Mandarin. I love sports and play badminton and tennis weekly!
    </p>

    <h3>Interest in IT<br>
	</h3>
	<br>
     <p>My interest in IT stems from playing video games at an early age. Throughout the years I’ve played a huge variety of video games, from single player console games such as Pokemon Sapphire to Mobas like Dota 2. I’ve always wondered how these games or applications run behind the scenes, how computers talk to each other, and how the internet allows communication worldwide at dizzying speeds.
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 I would say my particular field of interest in IT is cloud computing, and would like to go into a related field in the future. Recently I’ve pursued these interests by teaching myself how to code, particularly python, and completing multiple certifications on the Amazon Web Services framework, including the Solutions Architect Professional and the Security Specialty.
<br>
<br>
I chose RMIT for the Bachelor of IT as it is a fully online course, allowing me to study alongside my Electrical Engineering degree. I’m currently 3 weeks into starting this degree and I’m loving the flexibility it offers.
<br>
<br>
As I have no experience working professionally in IT, I hope this degree would give me the necessary knowledge and skills to step foot into the world of IT. I expect to learn all the basic principles of IT, and be able to code at an intermediate level in multiple languages. I also expect to learn how to apply this knowledge in real life situations, and solve any potential problems that could come up.
